# Useful stuff

In this repository I intend to put some small but (questionably) useful stuff.

## random_mp3.py

When you need to fill your car flash drive with music, but doesn't have the time to cherry pick all the songs, this script might be useful.  
Usage:

```
python3 random_mp3.py <mp3 source folder> <mp3 dest folder> <size to copy in Mb>
```

*Note 1*: Python3 is required  
*Note 2*: Tested only on Linux
